## Key Security Principles

- **Data Privacy**: **stone.proof** ensures sensitive supply chain data is protected using cryptographic techniques and private data collections. Only authorized parties can access this information.
  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Each participant in the supply chain (e.g., Miner, Refiner, Transporter, Auditor, Buyer) has predefined permissions to prevent unauthorized actions.
  
- **Smart Contract Validation**: Transactions are validated through robust chaincode to detect and prevent fraud or tampering.
